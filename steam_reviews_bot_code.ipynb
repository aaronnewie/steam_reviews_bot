We want Dragon Quest X localized, we want simultaneous releases and full support for these beautiful games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts and all the franchises you're neglecting and not promoting enough![/b]\\n\\nDragon Quest XI has taught me many a great lessons. It helped me to learn how to appreciate games, classical music, how to enjoy turn-based combat and how to be patient. It's a game unlike any other and something that cannot be missed.\\nAs for the \"Definitive Edition\", there are many different changes and additions which make this version of the game truly \"Definitive\". The most important ones are all the story additions, 2D mode which makes the game look and play like the old SNES games, improved artistic quality, an option for symphonic soundtrack, the original Japanese voice-acting, party members following The Hero instead of dissapearing after cutscenes like in old JRPG... The list can go on. Unfortunately, some of the graphical quality of the original version was lost, that is because the Definitive version was essentially redeveloped for Nintendo Switch and wasn't supposed to release on other platforms. They had to remake the game to make it work on Switch. I've seen various comparisons on the Internet and honestly, sometimes the difference is barely visible. If you aren't obsessed with \"rigs\" and \"tesselation\", you probably won't even notice the technical difference and I can guarantee that the new content is very much worth the 40$ price tag. Especially for those who are yet to experience the world of Dragon Quest XI.\\n\\nThe addition of a symphonic orchestra option is a change I'm sure many people will appreciate. I personally think that the reason why people did not enjoy the original music was because of the added English voice-acting. Originally Dragon Quest XI came out in Japan without voice-acting. The game's cutscenes are built similar to the way older JRPG played - lots of music, no voice-acting, dialogue boxes. The soundtrack is composed in such a way that really tells its own story and replaces the voice-acting, lets you get absorbed into that world. So, when you add voice-acting on top of it... it's just too much. I personally played DQ XI on PS4 with no voice-acting and I recommend this way of play to everyone. The developers did add Japanese voice-acting after (!) Western release. I feel like they kind of had to do it and go against their vision to not have any confusion as to why English version has voices and Japanese doesn't. So, now there are options if you would prefer to play with voices on (English or Japanese). I strongly recommend to play it without any voice-acting, though. I'd go as far as to say that the game is built in a way similar to silent movies of XX century. \\n\\n[b]Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition is a game I recommend to every single gamer out there. It's an absolute miracle that this game exists! Along with Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XIV, Persona 5 - Dragon Quest XI proudly takes the place of one of the best JRPG games of this generation.

However, it still looks  and plays better than the Nintendo Switch version as you're getting a higher resolution and an unlocked frame rate.\\n\\nI'd recommend getting this on Xbox Game Pass if you bought the original and want to save money. I agree this should have been a free upgrade for those that bought the original.  \n",

              "736  [h1][b]A fantastic, truly beautiful and inspiring game.[/b] [/h1]\\n[b]Square Enix, hear me! We want more of this! We want Dragon Quest X localized, we want simultaneous releases and full support for these beautiful games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts and all the franchises you're neglecting and not promoting enough![/b]\\n\\nDragon Quest XI has taught me many a great lessons. It helped me to learn how to appreciate games, classical music, how to enjoy turn-based combat and how to be patient. It's a game unlike any other and something that cannot be missed.\\nAs for the \"Definitive Edition\", there are many different changes and additions which make this version of the game truly \"Definitive\". The most important ones are all the story additions, 2D mode which makes the game look and play like the old SNES games, improved artistic quality, an option for symphonic soundtrack, the original Japanese voice-acting, party members following The Hero instead of dissapearing after cutscenes like in old JRPG... The list can go on. Unfortunately, some of the graphical quality of the original version was lost, that is because the Definitive version was essentially redeveloped for Nintendo Switch and wasn't supposed to release on other platforms. They had to remake the game to make it work on Switch. I've seen various comparisons on the Internet and honestly, sometimes the difference is barely visible. If you aren't obsessed with \"rigs\" and \"tesselation\", you probably won't even notice the technical difference and I can guarantee that the new content is very much worth the 40$ price tag. Especially for those who are yet to experience the world of Dragon Quest XI.\\n\\nThe addition of a symphonic orchestra option is a change I'm sure many people will appreciate. I personally think that the reason why people did not enjoy the original music was because of the added English voice-acting. Originally Dragon Quest XI came out in Japan without voice-acting. The game's cutscenes are built similar to the way older JRPG played - lots of music, no voice-acting, dialogue boxes. The soundtrack is composed in such a way that really tells its own story and replaces the voice-acting, lets you get absorbed into that world. So, when you add voice-acting on top of it... it's just too much. I personally played DQ XI on PS4 with no voice-acting and I recommend this way of play to everyone. The developers did add Japanese voice-acting after (!) Western release. I feel like they kind of had to do it and go against their vision to not have any confusion as to why English version has voices and Japanese doesn't. So, now there are options if you would prefer to play with voices on (English or Japanese). I strongly recommend to play it without any voice-acting, though. I'd go as far as to say that the game is built in a way similar to silent movies of XX century. \\n\\n[b]Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition is a game I recommend to every single gamer out there. It's an absolute miracle that this game exists! Along with Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XIV, Persona 5 - Dragon Quest XI proudly takes the place of one of the best JRPG games of this generation.

You're EXHAUSTED but yet no sleepy. You would like to do something, maybe play some games but you also want to relax, no other stress needed. Something that challenges you but that's relatively easy to understand. You want something that transports you in a world different than yours, a world that helps forget yours for a couple of hours. You want to experience loyal companions, big cities, witching witches, mysterious dungeons, evil monsters... \\nYou want to forget that day you went through.\\nThen Dragon Quest XI S is exactly what you need.\\n\\nAnd dayum, the Draconian difficulties are so much fun!

              "      <td>[h1][b]A fantastic, truly beautiful and inspiring game.[/b] [/h1]\\n[b]Square Enix, hear me! We want more of this! We want Dragon Quest X localized, we want simultaneous releases and full support for these beautiful games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts and all the franchises you're neglecting and not promoting enough![/b]\\n\\nDragon Quest XI has taught me many a great lessons. It helped me to learn how to appreciate games, classical music, how to enjoy turn-based combat and how to be patient. It's a game unlike any other and something that cannot be missed.\\nAs for the \"Definitive Edition\", there are many different changes and additions which make this version of the game truly \"Definitive\". The most important ones are all the story additions, 2D mode which makes the game look and play like the old SNES games, improved artistic quality, an option for symphonic soundtrack, the original Japanese voice-acting, party members following The Hero instead of dissapearing after cutscenes like in old JRPG... The list can go on. Unfortunately, some of the graphical quality of the original version was lost, that is because the Definitive version was essentially redeveloped for Nintendo Switch and wasn't supposed to release on other platforms. They had to remake the game to make it work on Switch. I've seen various comparisons on the Internet and honestly, sometimes the difference is barely visible. If you aren't obsessed with \"rigs\" and \"tesselation\", you probably won't even notice the technical difference and I can guarantee that the new content is very much worth the 40$ price tag. Especially for those who are yet to experience the world of Dragon Quest XI.\\n\\nThe addition of a symphonic orchestra option is a change I'm sure many people will appreciate. I personally think that the reason why people did not enjoy the original music was because of the added English voice-acting. Originally Dragon Quest XI came out in Japan without voice-acting. The game's cutscenes are built similar to the way older JRPG played - lots of music, no voice-acting, dialogue boxes. The soundtrack is composed in such a way that really tells its own story and replaces the voice-acting, lets you get absorbed into that world. So, when you add voice-acting on top of it... it's just too much. I personally played DQ XI on PS4 with no voice-acting and I recommend this way of play to everyone. The developers did add Japanese voice-acting after (!) Western release. I feel like they kind of had to do it and go against their vision to not have any confusion as to why English version has voices and Japanese doesn't. So, now there are options if you would prefer to play with voices on (English or Japanese). I strongly recommend to play it without any voice-acting, though. I'd go as far as to say that the game is built in a way similar to silent movies of XX century. \\n\\n[b]Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition is a game I recommend to every single gamer out there. It's an absolute miracle that this game exists! Along with Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XIV, Persona 5 - Dragon Quest XI proudly takes the place of one of the best JRPG games of this generation.

However, it still looks  and plays better than the Nintendo Switch version as you're getting a higher resolution and an unlocked frame rate.\\n\\nI'd recommend getting this on Xbox Game Pass if you bought the original and want to save money. I agree this should have been a free upgrade for those that bought the original.  \n",

              "736  [h1][b]A fantastic, truly beautiful and inspiring game.[/b] [/h1]\\n[b]Square Enix, hear me! We want more of this! We want Dragon Quest X localized, we want simultaneous releases and full support for these beautiful games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts and all the franchises you're neglecting and not promoting enough![/b]\\n\\nDragon Quest XI has taught me many a great lessons. It helped me to learn how to appreciate games, classical music, how to enjoy turn-based combat and how to be patient. It's a game unlike any other and something that cannot be missed.\\nAs for the \"Definitive Edition\", there are many different changes and additions which make this version of the game truly \"Definitive\". The most important ones are all the story additions, 2D mode which makes the game look and play like the old SNES games, improved artistic quality, an option for symphonic soundtrack, the original Japanese voice-acting, party members following The Hero instead of dissapearing after cutscenes like in old JRPG... The list can go on. Unfortunately, some of the graphical quality of the original version was lost, that is because the Definitive version was essentially redeveloped for Nintendo Switch and wasn't supposed to release on other platforms. They had to remake the game to make it work on Switch. I've seen various comparisons on the Internet and honestly, sometimes the difference is barely visible. If you aren't obsessed with \"rigs\" and \"tesselation\", you probably won't even notice the technical difference and I can guarantee that the new content is very much worth the 40$ price tag. Especially for those who are yet to experience the world of Dragon Quest XI.\\n\\nThe addition of a symphonic orchestra option is a change I'm sure many people will appreciate. I personally think that the reason why people did not enjoy the original music was because of the added English voice-acting. Originally Dragon Quest XI came out in Japan without voice-acting. The game's cutscenes are built similar to the way older JRPG played - lots of music, no voice-acting, dialogue boxes. The soundtrack is composed in such a way that really tells its own story and replaces the voice-acting, lets you get absorbed into that world. So, when you add voice-acting on top of it... it's just too much. I personally played DQ XI on PS4 with no voice-acting and I recommend this way of play to everyone. The developers did add Japanese voice-acting after (!) Western release. I feel like they kind of had to do it and go against their vision to not have any confusion as to why English version has voices and Japanese doesn't. So, now there are options if you would prefer to play with voices on (English or Japanese). I strongly recommend to play it without any voice-acting, though. I'd go as far as to say that the game is built in a way similar to silent movies of XX century. \\n\\n[b]Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition is a game I recommend to every single gamer out there. It's an absolute miracle that this game exists! Along with Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XIV, Persona 5 - Dragon Quest XI proudly takes the place of one of the best JRPG games of this generation.

You're EXHAUSTED but yet no sleepy. You would like to do something, maybe play some games but you also want to relax, no other stress needed. Something that challenges you but that's relatively easy to understand. You want something that transports you in a world different than yours, a world that helps forget yours for a couple of hours. You want to experience loyal companions, big cities, witching witches, mysterious dungeons, evil monsters... \\nYou want to forget that day you went through.\\nThen Dragon Quest XI S is exactly what you need.\\n\\nAnd dayum, the Draconian difficulties are so much fun!

It is extremely lazy on their part that it is simply a port of the Switch version.*\\nI think it's terrible that Square Enix charges for this upgrade, it should be free. Or at least, with a significant discount.\\nAlso, they have removed the original version of the game from the store (although if you had already bought it, you can still download it, fortunately).\\n\\nAlso, there are no specific button prompts for each type of controller (at least, not for KB+M). This is ridiculous, even Spike Chunsoft has been able to do this in the last game they released for Steam, Shiren the Wanderer, which is also a console port.\\n\\nTo try to improve the graphic aspect a little bit, take a look at this, because I don't think Square Enix is going to try to improve anything in this aspect.\\nhttps://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_-_Definitive_Edition\\n\\n* The textures seem to be better than the Switch version, (but not at the level of the original), and they have made some changes in the lighting (some for the better, some for the worse), but the quality of the character models and the quality and density of the grass leave much to be desired. Also very low draw distance and no anti-aliasing in the graphic options menu (but you can fix it thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide).\\nFor more information about the graphic differences between the original version and this one, read this thread.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1295510/discussions/0/3006676913236433192/\\n\\nPS: There are certain points in this review that I would like to go into a little more deeply. DQXI is a magnificent JRPG in all senses, whether in the approach and development of the main plot, main characters and their respective plot arcs, music, enemy design, etc. Also, the game still looks great, but not as great as the original (this is the part that bothers me so much, because it looks extremely lazy from Square Enix, as if they didn't want to spend more time and budget to adapt the models of the original game to the engine of this new version). The 2D mode is fabulous, and I'm sure it's great for a 2nd run, and the QOL improvements are very much appreciated. The new orchestral soundtrack is beautiful. I haven't been able to see anything about the new content yet, so I can't give an opinion on it. What I mean is that if you don't have the original game, buy it without thinking, it's an incredible game, and I'm sure there's some shop where you can see it at a discount. But if you own the original version, I wouldn't recommend you to pay more than 10 - 15 €/$ for this game, there are many other games you can play while waiting for that to happen.\\n\\nTL;DR: An extremely lazy port, the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. You can fix some things thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide, but others, like the quality of the models, you can't. Don't expect much post-launch support, also the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. Buy it if you don't have the original game. If you have it, wait until it is 10 - 15 €/$.</td>\n",

              "726  It looks bad compared to the original version. It is extremely lazy on their part that it is simply a port of the Switch version.*\\nI think it's terrible that Square Enix charges for this upgrade, it should be free. Or at least, with a significant discount.\\nAlso, they have removed the original version of the game from the store (although if you had already bought it, you can still download it, fortunately).\\n\\nAlso, there are no specific button prompts for each type of controller (at least, not for KB+M). This is ridiculous, even Spike Chunsoft has been able to do this in the last game they released for Steam, Shiren the Wanderer, which is also a console port.\\n\\nTo try to improve the graphic aspect a little bit, take a look at this, because I don't think Square Enix is going to try to improve anything in this aspect.\\nhttps://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_-_Definitive_Edition\\n\\n* The textures seem to be better than the Switch version, (but not at the level of the original), and they have made some changes in the lighting (some for the better, some for the worse), but the quality of the character models and the quality and density of the grass leave much to be desired. Also very low draw distance and no anti-aliasing in the graphic options menu (but you can fix it thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide).\\nFor more information about the graphic differences between the original version and this one, read this thread.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1295510/discussions/0/3006676913236433192/\\n\\nPS: There are certain points in this review that I would like to go into a little more deeply. DQXI is a magnificent JRPG in all senses, whether in the approach and development of the main plot, main characters and their respective plot arcs, music, enemy design, etc. Also, the game still looks great, but not as great as the original (this is the part that bothers me so much, because it looks extremely lazy from Square Enix, as if they didn't want to spend more time and budget to adapt the models of the original game to the engine of this new version). The 2D mode is fabulous, and I'm sure it's great for a 2nd run, and the QOL improvements are very much appreciated. The new orchestral soundtrack is beautiful. I haven't been able to see anything about the new content yet, so I can't give an opinion on it. What I mean is that if you don't have the original game, buy it without thinking, it's an incredible game, and I'm sure there's some shop where you can see it at a discount. But if you own the original version, I wouldn't recommend you to pay more than 10 - 15 €/$ for this game, there are many other games you can play while waiting for that to happen.\\n\\nTL;DR: An extremely lazy port, the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. You can fix some things thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide, but others, like the quality of the models, you can't. Don't expect much post-launch support, also the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. Buy it if you don't have the original game. If you have it, wait until it is 10 - 15 €/$.  \n",

[/h1]\\n\\nMany people view the gameplay of a JRPG as their secondary objective, as if the story is some holier than now narrative that will carry the pacing on it's own merit. Dragon Quest 11s' story is very simple however, with the protagonist hailing from a small village must leave his humble roots in order to save the world. Despite the premise of such story being so contrived and non-innovative, the key story itself builds upon the foundation on it's many memorable characters that act as a direct defiance of the status quo and propel the (albeit silent) protagonist into the role of the player with some of the best world building I've seen accomplish in any game. It never questions the grasp on someone's judgement whether this is reality, but whether this is a fully functioning world all on it's own. \\n\\n[b] Mild gameplay spoiler [/b]\\n\\nWhat I mean by this is there's a point in the game where you reach a sacred library of mythical tales and a optional book you read in there speaks of a dragon who was sealed away in ice 1000's of years ago. If you decide to go for some mild exploring outside that area, you will be able to find a dragon directly frozen in ice, but the real conclusion is far later in the game where you re-visit the area only to find [spoiler] that the ice has melted and the dragon is nowhere to be seen. If you missed the optional book encounter you would not understand the significance of the dragon escaping the ice as most people would either remember there was a dragon or forget it all entirely [/spoiler]\\n\\nThis is the approach the Dragon Quest 11s tends to deal with it's exposition about the world, yet moments of direct character growth is also wonderful to witness too.\\n\\nThe gameplay is something that should have far higher priority in subject of a \"game review\", but the gameplay is really enjoyable. I really think this is the perfected form of turn-based combat, even though many people view that system of play with inherent contempt. Throughout standard gameplay, battles are won more-so by the preparation done before battles than the actions within so, however, luck is a consistent theme in this game so even go into a battle without correct upgrades, you could quite easily come out the victor. The game employs a crafting system for upgrades, that has every quality of life improvement from the original Dragon Quest 11. You can check the map for locations of materials and can easily access the forge from the menu so it makes crafting feels less tedious and more rewarding exploration. Each character has their own unique skill trees that can be upgraded upon a level up, or easily reset in a church. This is where I spent most of my time theorising and testing out the best possible combinations of skills.\\n\\nI have played every single Dragon Quest game since it's inception and this game is easily the game I would recommend for new-comers of the franchise. It's both easy to engage yourself for a while and make severe progress based on the great pacing and easy to endure long sessions normally expected of a JRPG and feel this unbridled ecstasy of seeing yourself progress so much of the game.\\n\\nThat said, if you wish to 100% the game like I did - this is not a short game whatsoever. I unlocked every steam achievement after 152.7 hours of gametime and if you just want to experience all that you want to do, than you will have to expect a total playtime of 100 hours.</td>\n",

              "401  [h1] As someone who has committed a good portion of their life to what some could perceive as a JRPG connoisseur since childhood: I can say without a doubt - that this is the best JRPG of this last decade. [/h1]\\n\\nMany people view the gameplay of a JRPG as their secondary objective, as if the story is some holier than now narrative that will carry the pacing on it's own merit. Dragon Quest 11s' story is very simple however, with the protagonist hailing from a small village must leave his humble roots in order to save the world. Despite the premise of such story being so contrived and non-innovative, the key story itself builds upon the foundation on it's many memorable characters that act as a direct defiance of the status quo and propel the (albeit silent) protagonist into the role of the player with some of the best world building I've seen accomplish in any game. It never questions the grasp on someone's judgement whether this is reality, but whether this is a fully functioning world all on it's own. \\n\\n[b] Mild gameplay spoiler [/b]\\n\\nWhat I mean by this is there's a point in the game where you reach a sacred library of mythical tales and a optional book you read in there speaks of a dragon who was sealed away in ice 1000's of years ago. If you decide to go for some mild exploring outside that area, you will be able to find a dragon directly frozen in ice, but the real conclusion is far later in the game where you re-visit the area only to find [spoiler] that the ice has melted and the dragon is nowhere to be seen. If you missed the optional book encounter you would not understand the significance of the dragon escaping the ice as most people would either remember there was a dragon or forget it all entirely [/spoiler]\\n\\nThis is the approach the Dragon Quest 11s tends to deal with it's exposition about the world, yet moments of direct character growth is also wonderful to witness too.\\n\\nThe gameplay is something that should have far higher priority in subject of a \"game review\", but the gameplay is really enjoyable. I really think this is the perfected form of turn-based combat, even though many people view that system of play with inherent contempt. Throughout standard gameplay, battles are won more-so by the preparation done before battles than the actions within so, however, luck is a consistent theme in this game so even go into a battle without correct upgrades, you could quite easily come out the victor. The game employs a crafting system for upgrades, that has every quality of life improvement from the original Dragon Quest 11. You can check the map for locations of materials and can easily access the forge from the menu so it makes crafting feels less tedious and more rewarding exploration. Each character has their own unique skill trees that can be upgraded upon a level up, or easily reset in a church. This is where I spent most of my time theorising and testing out the best possible combinations of skills.\\n\\nI have played every single Dragon Quest game since it's inception and this game is easily the game I would recommend for new-comers of the franchise. It's both easy to engage yourself for a while and make severe progress based on the great pacing and easy to endure long sessions normally expected of a JRPG and feel this unbridled ecstasy of seeing yourself progress so much of the game.\\n\\nThat said, if you wish to 100% the game like I did - this is not a short game whatsoever. I unlocked every steam achievement after 152.7 hours of gametime and if you just want to experience all that you want to do, than you will have to expect a total playtime of 100 hours.  \n",

Easily seeing myself playing this game for hundreds of hours. \\n Even though I am not one of those who suffered from the Edition of Light purchased, I support the addition of upgrade to this game. Sad to see the Square Enix doing their fans dirty like this!  \n",

              "      <td>It looks bad compared to the original version. It is extremely lazy on their part that it is simply a port of the Switch version.*\\nI think it's terrible that Square Enix charges for this upgrade, it should be free. Or at least, with a significant discount.\\nAlso, they have removed the original version of the game from the store (although if you had already bought it, you can still download it, fortunately).\\n\\nAlso, there are no specific button prompts for each type of controller (at least, not for KB+M). This is ridiculous, even Spike Chunsoft has been able to do this in the last game they released for Steam, Shiren the Wanderer, which is also a console port.\\n\\nTo try to improve the graphic aspect a little bit, take a look at this, because I don't think Square Enix is going to try to improve anything in this aspect.\\nhttps://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_-_Definitive_Edition\\n\\n* The textures seem to be better than the Switch version, (but not at the level of the original), and they have made some changes in the lighting (some for the better, some for the worse), but the quality of the character models and the quality and density of the grass leave much to be desired. Also very low draw distance and no anti-aliasing in the graphic options menu (but you can fix it thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide).\\nFor more information about the graphic differences between the original version and this one, read this thread.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1295510/discussions/0/3006676913236433192/\\n\\nPS: There are certain points in this review that I would like to go into a little more deeply. DQXI is a magnificent JRPG in all senses, whether in the approach and development of the main plot, main characters and their respective plot arcs, music, enemy design, etc. Also, the game still looks great, but not as great as the original (this is the part that bothers me so much, because it looks extremely lazy from Square Enix, as if they didn't want to spend more time and budget to adapt the models of the original game to the engine of this new version). The 2D mode is fabulous, and I'm sure it's great for a 2nd run, and the QOL improvements are very much appreciated. The new orchestral soundtrack is beautiful. I haven't been able to see anything about the new content yet, so I can't give an opinion on it. What I mean is that if you don't have the original game, buy it without thinking, it's an incredible game, and I'm sure there's some shop where you can see it at a discount. But if you own the original version, I wouldn't recommend you to pay more than 10 - 15 €/$ for this game, there are many other games you can play while waiting for that to happen.\\n\\nTL;DR: An extremely lazy port, the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. You can fix some things thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide, but others, like the quality of the models, you can't. Don't expect much post-launch support, also the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. Buy it if you don't have the original game. If you have it, wait until it is 10 - 15 €/$.</td>\n",

              "726  It looks bad compared to the original version. It is extremely lazy on their part that it is simply a port of the Switch version.*\\nI think it's terrible that Square Enix charges for this upgrade, it should be free. Or at least, with a significant discount.\\nAlso, they have removed the original version of the game from the store (although if you had already bought it, you can still download it, fortunately).\\n\\nAlso, there are no specific button prompts for each type of controller (at least, not for KB+M). This is ridiculous, even Spike Chunsoft has been able to do this in the last game they released for Steam, Shiren the Wanderer, which is also a console port.\\n\\nTo try to improve the graphic aspect a little bit, take a look at this, because I don't think Square Enix is going to try to improve anything in this aspect.\\nhttps://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_-_Definitive_Edition\\n\\n* The textures seem to be better than the Switch version, (but not at the level of the original), and they have made some changes in the lighting (some for the better, some for the worse), but the quality of the character models and the quality and density of the grass leave much to be desired. Also very low draw distance and no anti-aliasing in the graphic options menu (but you can fix it thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide).\\nFor more information about the graphic differences between the original version and this one, read this thread.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1295510/discussions/0/3006676913236433192/\\n\\nPS: There are certain points in this review that I would like to go into a little more deeply. DQXI is a magnificent JRPG in all senses, whether in the approach and development of the main plot, main characters and their respective plot arcs, music, enemy design, etc. Also, the game still looks great, but not as great as the original (this is the part that bothers me so much, because it looks extremely lazy from Square Enix, as if they didn't want to spend more time and budget to adapt the models of the original game to the engine of this new version). The 2D mode is fabulous, and I'm sure it's great for a 2nd run, and the QOL improvements are very much appreciated. The new orchestral soundtrack is beautiful. I haven't been able to see anything about the new content yet, so I can't give an opinion on it. What I mean is that if you don't have the original game, buy it without thinking, it's an incredible game, and I'm sure there's some shop where you can see it at a discount. But if you own the original version, I wouldn't recommend you to pay more than 10 - 15 €/$ for this game, there are many other games you can play while waiting for that to happen.\\n\\nTL;DR: An extremely lazy port, the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. You can fix some things thanks to the pcgamingwiki guide, but others, like the quality of the models, you can't. Don't expect much post-launch support, also the general rule of Square Enix PC ports. Buy it if you don't have the original game. If you have it, wait until it is 10 - 15 €/$.  \n",
